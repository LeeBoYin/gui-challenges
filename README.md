# Bo-Yin's GUI Challenges

Hi, I'm a frontend web engineer, passionate about building sophisticated user interfaces and crafting quality UI components and libraries.
This project is inspired by [Adam Argyle's GUI Challenges](https://github.com/argyleink/gui-challenges), to showcase what and how I built challenging GUI.

## Components
- Bottom Sheet (WIP)
- [Tabs](src/components/Tabs) (Vue)
